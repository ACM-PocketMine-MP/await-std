Writing user-friendly PocketMine plugins fluently with await-generator style

# ARCHIVED
await-std contains several unrelated features
that don't really fit well in the same repo.
Maintaining such a bloated virion with the same versioning scheme
is not exactly a good idea,
especially when it is 

If you would like to continue maintaining this repo,
feel free to fork it.
However, I would recommend creating separate virions dedicated for each feature instead,
e.g. an `await-event` virion and a `sleep` virion.
